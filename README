A repo to store all knowledge I've gathered about the technical side of
mods. Most of this is gather from reading the code and should be
correct. Anything I'm not sure about or haven't looked into is marked with an
asterik* or is simply left out.

mods/ contains writeups about each mod that attempts to be as comprehensive as
possible (its only filled with what I specifically needed so its not that great)
projects/ contains writeups on projects either completed or in-progress
