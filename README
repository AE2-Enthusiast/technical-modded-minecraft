A repo to store all knowledge I've gathered about the technical side of
mods. Most of this is gathered from reading the code and should be
correct. Anything I'm not sure about or haven't looked into (aka making
assumptions about) is marked with an asterik* or is simply left out.

mods/ contains writeups about each mod that attempts to be as comprehensive as
possible (its only filled with what I specifically needed so its not that great). Each file is named after the mod's namespace to prevent naming conflicts and help searches.
projects/ contains writeups on projects either completed or in-progress
