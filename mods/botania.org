** Generating
*** Entropinnyum
 - Every tick, if empty on mana, checks for PrimedTNT entities within 12 blocks
   on each direction
 - The first TNT found with a fuse of 1, that isn't dead, and isn't in liquid
   - gets killed and adds max mana to the flower's buffer
 - The flower holds 6500 max mana which means each TNT is worth 6500 mana

* Entities
** Mana Burst
 - Default velocity is 0.4 m/t
 - Bursts have 0 size
 - Gravity (if it exists) is a constant value deducted from the velocity each tick
 - Every tick attempts to ping the spreader that shot it
   - Entity remembers the block pos that shot it and calls the `pingBack` method
     on the tile there

** Mana Spreader
*** Burst Properties
 | Props             |   Normal | Redstone | Dreamwood |     Gaia |
 |-------------------+----------+----------+-----------+----------|
 | Max Mana          |      160 |      160 |       240 |      640 |
 | Color             | 0x20FF20 | 0xFF2020 |  0xFF45C4 | 0x20FF20 |
 | Ticks before Loss |       60 |       60 |        80 |      120 |
 | Loss per Tick     |        4 |        4 |         4 |       20 |
 | Motion Modifier   |        1 |        1 |      1.25 |        2 |

 - Max Mana is how much mana the burst takes from the spreader
 - Color is the color of the burst
 - Ticks before Loss is
 - Loss per Tick is
 - Motion Modifier is a multiplier on the burst's velocity

*** Shooting Logic
 - Every tick
   - If `canShootBurst` isn't set (due to existing burst)
     - If `pingbackTicks` <= 0
       - Searches in a box for a `IManaBurst` matching its burst
       - If it finds one, it forces it to ping back
       - Otherwise, sets `canShootBurst`
     - Else
       - It decrements `pingbackTicks`
   - Shoots a burst if `canShootBurst` is set
   - Bursts spawn in center of mana spreader, angled identically
     - Seems to spawn with 1 tick of motion already applied though???
       - Can cause bursts to clip through blocks

*** General Logic
 - When pinged, `pingBackTicks` is set to 20
   - Meaning the mana burst can stop existing for 20 ticks before the spreader notices

** Lens
 | Lens       | Max Mana |   TTL | Loss/t |    MM |      g |
 |------------+----------+-------+--------+-------+--------|
 | Efficiency |          |       |   0.2x |  1.1x |        |

 | Messenger  |     0.2x |    3x |        |    3x |        |
 | Power      |       2x |       |     2x | 0.85x |        |
 | Speed      |    0.75x |  1/3x |     2x |    2x |        |
 | Time       |          | 2.25x |        |  0.8x |        |
 
 
 - Lenses' effects are applied by the spreader as it creates a new burst
 - Additionally lenses have methods that are called on collisions and every tick
 - Lens can also control how much mana is transferred to collided objects
 - Composite lens are applied one after the other, stacking multiplicatively
