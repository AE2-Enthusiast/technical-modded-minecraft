* Misc
** Bosses
*** Ender Dragon
 - The Dragon is composed of two halves, the entity itself that flys around and acts like
   any other entity. The other half is the DragonFightManager that controls
   global things like the health bar and the crystal count

**** Ender Dragon Entity
 - The entity is just the entity, it communicates with the manager to keep it up
   to date with its status
   - She has 200 health
   - Is 16x8x16 m
   - Has noClip
   - Is ImmuneToFire
   - Apparently is always rendered, iirespective of if she's on-screen, but
     doesn't seem so in-game?
 - 
 - When the ender dragon is created, she'll get the dimension's
   DragonFightManager, if the dimension is of type WorldProviderEnd
   - Otherwise most manager stuff will be ignored
 - Any damage that doesn't hit the dragon's head is quartered + min(damage, 1)
**** Dragon Fight Manager
 - The manager is a global thing for only the End (any dimension of type
   WorldProviderEnd should have one)
***** Tick Breakdown
 - Every tick the manager reasserts the boss info being visible or not if the
   dragon is alive or dead respectively
 - Every 20 ticks the manager updates the nearby player list
   - This counts any alive player with 192 blocks of (0, 128, 0) in the
     dimension of the fight
 - Every tick, if there is at least one player in the list
   - Scans for legacy world fight, if it hasn't before
   - Updates the Respawn Sequence, if its active
   - If the Dragon hasn't been killed
     - If the Dragon isn't known, or hasn't been seen for 1200 ticks (1 min)
       - Load chunks, then select first alive dragon in the world, and make it
         the new Dragon
       - Otherwise, spawn a new dragon immediately, and make it the Dragon
     - Every 100 ticks, scan for alive end crystals, and update the count

* Entities
