This project is being made for Divine Journey 2 v20.0 specifically, but will
most likely only use vanilla and components that can easily be replace by other
mods, ie using P2P tunnels for rf transfer could be replaced with
cryo-stabilized fluxducts.

* Overview
This project is just for optimizing a draconic reactor to it's absolute
limits. Also will be making pretty plots of the reactor's variables.

** Background
I feel like optimizing the reactor is pretty self explanatory honestly. It's
dangerous and complex, so it's natural to want to optimize it. As a side note
I've made a system that nearly perfectly optimizes the reactor using
OpenComputers. A computer program is much better and easier way to optimize the
reactor, but doing it in pure vanilla is cooler.

* Current Attempt
Something about PID controllers or something. I haven't thought much about this
yet.
